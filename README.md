# Facebook Recruiting IV: Human or Robot?
### Predict if an online bid is made by a machine or a human

<ins> Purpose: </ins>
<br> Human bidders on the site are becoming increasingly frustrated with their inability to win auctions vs. their software-controlled counterparts. As a result, usage from the site's core customer base is plummeting.
In order to rebuild customer happiness, the site owners need to eliminate computer generated bidding from their auctions. Their attempt at building a model to identify these bids using behavioral data, including bid frequency over short periods of time, has proven insufficient. 
The goal is to identify online auction bids that are placed by "robots", helping the site owners easily flag these users for removal from their site to prevent unfair auction activity.
